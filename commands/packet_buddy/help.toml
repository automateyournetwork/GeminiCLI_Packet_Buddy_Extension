ðŸ¦ˆ  Packet Buddy â€” AI-powered PCAP Analysis
===========================================

Quickly analyze packet captures end-to-end using GPT-4o and the Packet Copilot MCP.

Usage:
  /packet_buddy:analyze "Can you give me a L2â€“L4 summary of capture.pcap?"

This single command will:
  1. Start a new MCP session
  2. Upload your local PCAP
  3. Convert it to JSON with tshark
  4. Sanitize payloads (remove heavy / PII fields)
  5. Build embeddings & index the data
  6. Ask GPT-4o your analysis question

Example Prompts:
  â€¢ "Summarize the main protocols and ports."
  â€¢ "Identify the top talkers and flows."
  â€¢ "Are there any retransmissions or drops?"
  â€¢ "Show me HTTP, DNS, or ICMP activity."

Requirements:
  â€¢ OPENAI_API_KEY set
  â€¢ tshark installed and in PATH
  â€¢ packetcopilot_fastmcp_server.py running (stdio or HTTP)

Safety:
  No external uploads, all work stays local.
